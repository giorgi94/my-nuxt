# Vue Server Side Rendering Example

This project is a simple example for making project of `vuejs`, with server side rendering. In this example, I don't use `vue cli`, since it doesn't give enough freedom to make own configuration, which is most suitable for the project and I think it is important to understand how `webpack` or other build tools are configured.
